            <h2>Identifying GK profiles using data based on their play styles <br>and importance to their team for the
                2021/22 Premier League <br>Season</h2>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Goalkeepers prevent the opponents from scoring. They are the last line of defence, the ‘Guardian Angel’ of a
            team. As long as they can keep the ball out of their own net, the team cannot lose a match.
            However, this feels like an inadequate description. The role of goalkeeper has evolved the most in the last
            decade. The responsibility of a modern-day keeper lies beyond just stopping the opposition’s goal attempts.
            Goalkeepers are no longer an isolated team member, away from all of the action. They are involved in every
            passage of play: building up the attack, commanding a high defensive line, beating the opposition press,
            providing an outlet for progression both short and long to name a few. A shift in football ideologies has
            propelled the importance of goalkeepers to a higher level.
            The purpose of this article is to sort Premier League keepers into separate categories, which can hopefully
            be
            used for scouting similar profiles of players. This will help us identify the requirement and style of the
            team
            they play for and their strengths and weaknesses. We can form an opinion of what to expect and what not to
            expect from a certain profile of goalkeeper.</p>
        <h3>Metrics for analysis</h3>
        <p>Traditional metrics such as saves and clean sheets are not enough to value and quantify the contribution of a
            goalkeeper. Unfortunately, not much detailed data is available directly to assess goalkeepers. But with some
            searching, filtering and formulating we have availed data that can value goalkeeper contributions much
            better
            than traditional stats. However, by no means this data is an exact measurement of a goalkeeper's skill. We
            can
            only arrive at a general idea of that keeper's skillset.
            The metrics have been divided into four broad areas: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Shot-Stopping</li>
            <li>Box Control</li>
            <li>Sweeping</li>
            <li>Ball-Playing</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Shot-Stopping</h3>
        <p><em><strong>Post-Shot xG</strong></em> values the quality of the shot faced by the keeper, after the ball has left the
            foot (or body part) of the attacking player. High PSxG value signifies that the keeper has faced high
            quality
            shots. For this part we will consider the PSxG +/- which is calculated by (PSxG minus xG).<br>
            <em><strong>Goals Saved Above Average %</strong></em> measures the ability of the keeper to save shots. The model
            first
            computes the number of goals an average goalkeeper would concede for that given xG. Then it helps us to
            figure
            out whether our keeper has saved higher or lower than the average value.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Box Control</h3>
        <p><em><strong>Crosses Stopped %</strong></em> is the measure of stopped ball entries into the box from wide areas.<br>
            <em><strong>High Claims p90</strong></em> is the number of high ball collects performed by the keeper from balls over
            the
            defence, set-pieces and crosses.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Sweeping</h3>
        <p><em><strong>Defensive Actions p90</strong></em> performed outside the penalty area such as claiming, punching the
            ball,
            getting forward to reduce the shot angle or challenge a 1v1.<br>
            <em><strong>Avg. Distance of Actions</strong></em> of both inside and outside the penalty area. This gives an idea if
            the
            keeper strictly sticks to his line or if he does not hesitate to perform defensive actions to help out their
            defence.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Ball-Playing</h3>
        <p><em><strong>Build Up Involvement</strong></em> frequency of when goalkeeper has successfully played the ball to his
            teammates in live ball situations (i.e., excluding goal kicks, freekicks, corners and throw-ins)<br>
            <em><strong>Long Range Distribution</strong></em> is the completion rate of successful long passes over 40 yards
            distance
            towards the opponent half (this is a flawed metric because I could not separate long passes in dead ball
            situations from this stat).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Types of Goalkeepers in the Premier League</h2>
        <h3>Line Goalkeepers:</h3>
        <p>Line Goalkeepers are very athletic, excellent shot-stoppers and are equipped with lightning reflexes to
            recover
            quickly after blocking a shot. They are usually seen making acrobatic saves and multiple blocks in a short
            span
            of time. As the name suggests, these category of GKs are dedicated to staying deep near their goal line at
            all
            times.
            Line keepers have very limited technical ability on the ball. They are not involved in any build-up play
            only
            possess simple skill suitable for long goal kicks and freekicks. They also do not help out their defensive
            lines
            by coming out for claims and interceptions.<br>
            <em>Example: David de Gea</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures\Picture1.png" alt="David-De-Gea"></div><br>
        <hr>


        <br><h3>Classic Goalkeepers:</h3>
        <p>Classic goalkeepers are good at controlling their box by stopping crosses. They are able to circulate
            possession
            to beat the opposition press, but usually not much involved in the build-up phase. Their ball playing
            ability is
            above average and are able to reach both short and long range zones if needed. Classic GKs are also very
            good at
            shot-stopping<br>
            <em>Example: Edouard Mendy, Martin Dúbravka</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture2.png" alt="Edouard-Mendy">
            <img src="Pictures/Picture3.png" alt="Martin-Dúbravka">
        </div>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>Anticipative Goalkeepers</h3>
        <p>Similar to classic keepers, Anticipative GKs are very dominant inside the penalty area, but also outside
            their
            box. They are aggressive in their positioning, able to manoeuvre easily and also have an elite ability to
            read
            the play and ball trajectories. Therefore, they can anticipate and stop opposition attacks with expert
            accuracy.
            Anticipative keepers are effective in playing for teams that are dominated in possession and concede a lot
            of
            chances. They have a big presence between the sticks but average passing technique. But they can swiftly
            launch
            counter attacks against the run of play to help out their team.<br>
            <em>Example: Nick Pope, José Sá</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture4.png" alt="Nick-Pope">
            <img src="Pictures/Picture5.png" alt="José-Sá">
        </div>
        <br><hr><br>


        <h3>Proactive Goalkeepers</h3>
        <p>Proactive Goalkeepers actively take part in their team’s build up. They have good passing ability using which
            they help their team in progressing the ball forward when in possession. Some keepers have the capability of
            playing between high defensive lines, settling in between the centre-backs to receive the ball and play it
            in
            space where they have a spare man waiting. They are also useful in changing flanks.
            The shot-stopping ability of most proactive keepers is above average. They are also good enough in
            intercepting
            and breaking up attacks as well as having control over their box.<br>
            <em>Example: Robert Sánchez, Aaron Ramsdale</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture6.png" alt="Robert-Sánchez">
            <img src="Pictures/Picture7.png" alt="Aaron-Ramsdale">
        </div>
        <br><hr><br>


        <h3>Complete Goalkeepers</h3>
        <p>Complete Goalkeepers possess all the facets of the modern game integrated into their palette. They are very
            good
            at stopping shots, can read the play and cover their defensive line in an elite way, have the ability to
            play
            like an outfield player and alternate short play and long play under pressure with impressive accuracy.<br>
            <em>Example: Alisson</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture8.png" alt="Alisson"></div>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>Libero Goalkeepers</h3>
        <p>The word ‘libero’ stands for ‘free’ in Italian. A Libero Goalkeeper is ever-present as an extra man behind
            the
            defenders to serve as a passing option. Libero is the player that most of the deep build-up starts from.
            They
            are able to circulate the ball even under pressure and can transform any situation into an attack.
            Also performing great at keeping a high line by controlling the zone behind the defensive line. Most of them
            though, tend not to be dominant in the penalty area, helping the team way higher up the pitch, in and out of
            possession.<br>
            <em>Example: Ederson</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture9.png" alt="Ederson"></div>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>Reactive Goalkeepers</h3>
        <p>Reactive Goalkeepers possess average qualities in most areas. Instead of anticipating the danger beforehand,
            these GKs rely on their instincts when they sense danger. They are not comfortable with the ball at their
            feet.
            Instead, they tend to go long to reach the more advanced zones with their passing. Even though some of them
            are
            above average shot-stoppers, they have almost no sweeping skills and tend not to leave the security of their
            penalty area to take part in defensive actions.<br>
            <em>Example: Hugo Lloris, Łukasz Fabiański</em>
        </p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture10.png" alt="Hugo-Lloris">
            <img src="Pictures/Picture11.png" alt="Łukasz-Fabiański">
            
        </div>
        <br><hr><br>


        <h3>Ball Playing Goalkeepers and Sweeper Keepers</h3>
        <p>There are no Goalkeepers in the Premier League that excel only in ball-playing. GKs like Alisson and Ederson
            are
            excellent players on the ball but both of them are part of different keeper groups. They have their own
            skillset
            to go alongside the ball playing. Although we can consider <em>Vicente Guaita</em> for this one as he has no
            other remarkable traits in other areas.</p>
        <div class="img"><img src="Pictures/Picture12.png" alt="Vicente-Guaita"></div>

        <p>Similarly, there are no out and out sweeper keepers as well. Ramsdale and Ederson are adept at sweeping up
            behind
            their defences. But again, here we see both of them belong to different clusters. Here we may consider
            <em>Emiliano Martinez</em> or <em>Jordan Pickford</em>, but they are far off the mark of sweeper set by no
            other
            than Manuel Neuer.
        </p>
